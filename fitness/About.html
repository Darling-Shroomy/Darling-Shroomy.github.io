				<h1>common exercizes</h1>
				<h1>The following are common exercizes that we encourage our clients to do as a part of their daily exercise routines. </h1>
				<dl>
						<dt>Burpee</dt>
						<dd>Burpees are great, full body exercises, a pushup followed by a leap in the air. Doing several burpees in a row can be tiring, but this versatile exercise may be worth the payoff, especially if you're looking for a way to build strength and endurance, while burning calories, and boosting your cardio fitness.</dd>
						<dt>Planks</dt>
						<dd>Begin by laying facedown on the floor. Then, lift yourself up, pressing your forearms into the ground and keeping your knees on the ground. Align your elbows directly underneath your shoulders, and tuck your booty in, so your body forms a straight line from your head to your knees. Continue to engage your core.</dd>
						<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
						<dd>Performed from a plank position, you'll alternate bringing one knee to your chest, then kick back out, speeding up each time until you're "running" against the floor. While the move sounds simple, mountain climbers work your entire body and raise your heart rate.</dd>
