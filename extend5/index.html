                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>using the sticky position will help users freely keep things on page. such as maybe the nav bar or their own choice of usage.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>the top and left properties moved the relative box slightly a few pixels from where it was originally positioned</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>the fixed box moved to the top right of the page, messing with the top or right properties mvoes the box of the depending pixels such if I set the top properties 100px, it moves the box 100 pixels away from the top</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>the absolute box moved to the bottom right of the page, messing with the bottom or right properties mvoes the box of the depending pixels such if I set the bottom properties 100px, it moves the box 100 pixels closer to the top but if i were to set 100px to the right property, it would move across the page from the right corner</p>
